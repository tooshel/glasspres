					<p style="font-size:60%;">
						Web Developer<br>
						Build in the physical world with wood<br>
						Arduino and Pi<br>
						AFOL<br>
						Been into Google longer than you<br>
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:30%;">Sheldon McGee has been a web developer since having to do things the REALLY hard way (Cold Fusion, ASP) before things got easier (PHP, ASP.NET) and then hard again (Rails, Node). He’s been a fan of Google API’s since before there were any and all Google hackers were really just map hackers. He has passion for building in the physical world too and uses maple and alder (no pine! except in plywood sometimes) whenever he can to make furniture for around his house (dresser bed, headboard, entertainment center, cabinets, etc). He also dabbles with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to get his embedded fix. AFOL and SNOT building (i.e. Technic). Oh, and he’s been to every Google I/O and has been wearing Google Glass almost every day since May no matter how much his “friends” make fun of him.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Really liked my bio from the website so it's here too. 
						<br>Can't believe people ARN'T into Google as much anymore
						<br>Yeah, yeah, you hate google now, you are just here for the prizes.

					<h2>Really a zealot?</h2>
					<blockquote cite="http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Zealot">Zealots are taught to hate their enemies with a white hot passion and to hunt them down without mercy.</blockquote>

					<aside class="notes">
						Love that quote . . . reminds me of people from a certian news channel.
						I have an iPad and a Macbook Air, use Windows everyday, and I launched my mini app on Azure, so maybe, you decide.

					<h1>People ask questions</h1>

					<p>These bullets are for me so don't read them (I don't want to be one of those presenters that just reads the slides).
					<br>I'm really nervous and trying to get into a groove!</p>

					<ul>
						<li>shown Glass to hundreds of people
						<li>WIDE range of knowlege out there
						<li>Figure I should bring everyone up to speed
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						I've shown Glass to hundreds of people. WIDE range of knowlege about the product. Some ask about it and have no idea what it is and a some know more than me about it. I figure I should bring everyone up to speed.

					<h1>No!</h1>
					<p>Is it recording me right now?</p>
					<p>Thanks alot funny people</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Unless you are in the food industry in which case it&#39;s recording and doing facial recognition to identify you and any food handling violations.

						Thanks SNL

					<h1>What is it?</h1>
					<h3>My most frequent answer:</h3>
					<blockquote cite="">Google Glass is really just an Android phone strapped to the side of my head, but without the "phone" part and without a screen so that makes interacting with it very different than what we're used to. --Sheldon McGee</blockquote>

					<h1>Hardware</h1>
					<img height="150" src="images/whiteglass.jpg">
					<p>Has a processor and memory and battery<br>(just like toasters do these days)

					<aside class="notes">
						So we all get the HARDWARE part, that's easy because we also have it in our pockets, (processor, memory, battery) and the new stuff, (the glass, the speaker, the touchpad)
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>New!</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>The glass prismy thing display <sup>TM</sup>
						<li>The bone conducting speaker
						<li>Touchpad (not new but not similar to a phone either)
					</ul>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h4>Missing? That's later.</h4>

				<section>
					<h1>Software</h1>
					<img height="150" src="images/whiteglass.jpg">
					<p>That it's running Android makes sense . . . but it certainly doens't LOOK like Android.

					<ul>
						<li>You have to <strong>activate</strong> it by looking up or touching the touchpad . . . annoying now that the Moto X is listening all the time.
						<li>You've heard of cards, right?</li>
						<li>The timeline?</li>
						<li>Glassware?</li>

					<h2>How do you like it?</h2>
					<p>Hard to answer in the 20 seconds I have until my daughter freaks out.</p>

					<h3>What I use it for</h3>
						<p>Alerts
						<p>Pictures/Video
						<p>Sharing those


					<aside class="notes">
						Overall, I like it for a few reasons: I don&#39;t need to keep checking my phone (and I get all important notifications), easy to take pictures and video and post to Twitter/FB/Google+ (be nice if were all at the same time).

					<h2>Missing Hardware</h2>
					<ul>

					<h1>Sideload an APK</h1>
					<blockquote cite="https://developers.google.com/glass/gdk">We are actively working on a Glass Development Kit (GDK) that allows you to build Glassware in the form of APKs.</blockquote>

					<aside class="notes">
						So it&#39;s not &quot;breaking your warranty&quot;
						<br>
						Glass is built on the Android 4.0.4 platform, so you can write APKs using the standard Android SDK (API Level 15) and sideload them onto Glass.
